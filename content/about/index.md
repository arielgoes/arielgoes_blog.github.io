I am a PhD candidate at UNICAMP (Brazil) within the Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering (Faculdade de Engenharia Elétrica e de Computação - FEEC). My [research]({{< ref "research" >}}) interests include network orchestration problems - mainly involving graphs - with a focus on data programmability, i.e., using the P4 language.

Additionally, I'm also interested in mobile networks. Currently, I'm working on the [OpenRAN Brazil](https://openranbrasil.org.br/) project, collaborating with different teams to enable UPF functionalities in the SD-Fabric component for programmable switches (P4-UPF). In this work, I'm directly involved in orchestrating containers in Kubernetes clusters to ensure the availability of user traffic services in the ONF software stack.

In my free time, I'm a music production enthusiast. I've been playing the piano since I was a child and have had some performances at local events. I also have some projects using FL Studio on my [Soundcloud channel](https://soundcloud.com/user-487953126/wisdowl-evidence-7).
